#JavaScript Syntax

JavaScript **syntax** is the set of rules, how JavaScript programs are constructed.

##JavaScript Programs

A **computer program** is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by the computer. In a programming language, these program instructions are called **statements**. JavaScript is a **programming language**. JavaScript statements are separated by **semicolons**.

Example:

```javascript
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;
```

:exclamation: In HTML, JavaScript programs can be executed by the web browser.

##JavaScript Values

The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values: Fixed values and variable values. Fixed values are called **literals**. Variable values are called **variables**.

##JavaScript Literals

The most important rules for writing fixed values are: **Numbers** are written with or without decimals:

```javascript
10.50

1001
```

**Strings** are text, written within double or single quotes:

```javascript
"John Doe"

'John Doe'
```

##JavaScript Variables

In a programming language, **variables** are used to **store** data values. JavaScript uses the **var** keyword to **declare** variables. An **equal** sign is used to **assign** values to variables.

In this example, x is defined as a variable. Then, x is assigned (given) the value 6:
